# How to be a good `Pulp` player.

`Pulp` is a colloborative game designed to help teams in the early stages of designing a software product.

Most often your team will be considering how to rough out a design for an app or website which is focussed on helping someone solve a real problem. You might be worried that you don't know a whole lot about digital product design, or you might be worried that you know a whole lot about that, but not about how you're going to solve the problem at hand.

Try not to worry too much.

`Pulp` works because the best outcomes come from teams which contain a rich mix of different experiences and perspectives. It is designed to make sure that every member of the team can contribute on a equal basis. That said, there are a few things you can try to keep in mind which will help that process along...

* **Paper is king**

  Oftentimes it is hard to explain what you have in mind, and not everyone thinks or communicates the same way. If you fear you might be talking too much, or if you're frustrated because you're having difficulty being heard, start making a prototype to demonstrate your idea.

  Keep an eye out for teammates doing this, and lend them your support.

  In a `Pulp` game prototypes are the key to progress.

* **Assume the best intentions**

  When a team-mate proposes something that you find yourself reacting against take a moment to explore. You're in a mixed-discipline team and it is very likely their point of view is influenced by factors you're not aware of. To succeed your team needs to discover what those factors are.

* **Be a champion for other ideas**

  You'll have great ideas in the course of your game of `Pulp`, and it is natural to promote and defend them. Sadly this doesn't always work well in a team game, and might lead you to be too tenacious - you've probably encountered this in others, and it can be dislikeable. A good way to guard against this is to devote your energy to exploring and embracing the ideas of others - trust that they'll do the same for yours.

* **Use the Testing phase to resolve deadlocks**

  Sometimes you'll find your team deadlocked between two or more solutions, with powerful factors weighing on either side. `Pulp` has a **Testing** phase to help with this. Instead of trying to argue it out put your efforts into designing a test which will help the team make a wise decision.
