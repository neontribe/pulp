# Testing

In the **Testing** phase of `Pulp` you get to find out how close your prototypes have come to meeting the objective you set for your game.

There are three steps to a test in `Pulp`.

## 1. The Setup

In the setup for the test the team define the test `scenario` and `task`, take on their roles, lay out the prototype, and prepare the environment.

### Roles

* **Facilitator**

  The *facilitator*'s job is to keep the test phase running smoothly, the key parts of this are:
  - Introducing the `scenario` and the `task` to the `tester` at the start of each test
  - Putting the `tester` at their ease
  - Helping the `tester` give useful feedback during and after the test
  - Covering for the `computer` in case of bugs and crashes

  *If you're assuming this role for the first time take a look at [advice for facilitators](./advice-for-facilitators.md)*

* **Computer**

  The `computer`'s job is to manipulate the paper prototype in response to the `tester`'s actions. The key parts of this are:
  - Understanding the prototype and how it is designed to behave
  - Rearranging the prototype to show how it responds to the `tester`'s actions
  - Making cute beeping and whirring noises

  *If you're assuming this role for the first time take a look at [advice for computers](./advice-for-computers.md)*

* **Observer**

  The `observer`'s job is to make notes of what the `tester` says and does during the test. This is harder than it sounds and primarily involves:
  - Watching and listening acutely
  - Noticing tiny things
  - Making useful notes

  *If you're assuming this role for the first time take a look at [advice for observers](./advice-for-observers.md)*

* **Tester**

  *It is better by far if the `tester` isn't a member of the team which made the prototype. If you're playing in a `Pulp` game with more than one team you should exchange one or more players to be the  `tester` for other teams for this phase. If that's not possible maybe you can find somebody who isn't playing in your game to help you out!*

  The `tester`'s role is to try to use the prototype to achieve the `task` which has been set for this test. This involves:
  - Listening carefully to the `scenario` and the `task`
  - Helping the other players by talking all the way through the test, describing thoughts, feelings and impressions.
