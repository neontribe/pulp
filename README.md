# Pulp

`Pulp` is a cooperative game which helps you use `paper-protoyping` to explore and refine your initial ideas for a digital project.

In `Pulp` you win or lose as a team, and even if you decide that you've lost you'll probably decide that you've learned enough to make the game more than worthwhile.

## Setup

### What do we need?

* Time
	- You can play your first game in a set time of 1.5 hours and expect to discover some useful things.
* Space
	- For each team you'll need a table to work at. If it is smaller then A1 size you'll probably feel cramped.
* Company
	- You can play `Pulp` solo, but it is much more fun as a team. For the best fun have more than one team playing at the same time! **Three** is a very useful team size in `Pulp` games.
	- It is best to have a mix of folk. Anyone can get involved. It is useful if they've looked through [How to be a good Pulp player](./player-guide.md)
* Stationery & Tools
	- `Pulp` games use a lot of stationery. For each team you'll need at least:
		- 1 sheet of A2 card
		- 5 sheets of A4 card
		- A set of printed parts
		- A set of printed 'Pulp' rules
		- A pair of scissors
		- A black marker pen
		- Some sticky-tack
	- More and more diverse stationery and tools can really add to the creativity and fun in a game of `Pulp`. Please see [Stationery Powerups](./stationery-powerups.md) for some favorites (warning: may contain brand names).

## How to Play

A game of `Pulp` is played over one or more **rounds** and each **round** has the same four **phases** so you'll always know where you are.

### Phase 1. Defining
Each team should fill out a [problem sheet](./problem-sheet.md) or reassess their problem sheet from the previous round (it is totally normal in `Pulp` to realise that the problem you're working on is, in some way, the wrong problem).

### Phase 2. Solutionizing
Each team should use a combination of [ready-made parts](./parts.md), and custom parts they create themselves, to build a paper-protoype of their solution to the problem. If this is your first time using paper-prototypes you might want to check out [Why Paper?](./why-paper.md).

### Phase 3. Testing
Each team should all take on roles and responsibilities from the [Testing a Paper Protoype](./testing-a-paper-prototype.md) sheet, then they should play through the testing minigame. This is the moment when having more than one team in the game really helps.

### Phase 4. Iterating
Each team should discuss the results of the testing phase and try to make changes to the prototype to incorporate the things they discovered.  

### Phase 5. Game End
A game ends for one of 3 reasons:
  - The players decide they've solved their problem - A WIN!
  - The players decide they'll never solve the problem - A LOSE!
  - You reach the end of a prearranged time or number of rounds without solving the problem - A DRAW!

If you've checked these three things, and none of them has happened it is time to start a new round!

You might be worried that a game of `Pulp` will be a big effort and might not result in a win for your team... Try not to worry. Good things almost always come out of a `Pulp` game, win or lose. Take a look at [Win by Losing](./win-by-losing.md) for tips about how to find the positives.
